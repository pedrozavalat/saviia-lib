- [ ] I applied the linter with `make lint` and fixed any issues. 
- [ ] I follow the conventional commits and I know that my branch should be named feat(<service>) when adding a new feature, fix(<service>) when fixing a bug, and refactor(<service>) or chore when doing maintenance work.
- [ ] I know that before merging, I need pull the latest changes from the main branch and make a release version of saviia-lib with `make release`.
